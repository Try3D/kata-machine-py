# Kata machine

## Introduction
An exercise-based project to practice common data structures and algorithms in python. Based on [ThePrimeagen's kata machine](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/kata-machine).

## Motivation
If I don't keep practicing data structures and algorithms, I forget it. Hence, I am building this to automate the boring parts of dsa which is designing the inteface and testing.

## Getting Started
Clone the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/try3d/kata-machine
```
Change into the directory:
```
cd kata-machine
```
Generate the exercise files:
```
python main.py generate
```
Start editing the files in `exercises/` directory.

## Usage
Start solving any question.

To run all tests, execute:
```
python main.py test
```

or to run only a specific test, run:
```
python main.py test :filename
```

NOTE: You don't have to enter the entire file name. You can fuzzy run tests. For example, `linked_list` can be shortened to `linked` or `list` or `l`.
